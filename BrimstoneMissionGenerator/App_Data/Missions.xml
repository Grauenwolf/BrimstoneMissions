It sounds too good to be true... and it probably is, but the old prospector swears up and down that he would go claim it himself if he were twenty years younger.&#xA;It's not hard to figure out which mine system he's talking about based on the landmarks he mentions, and though the other patrons he tells just dismiss him, this could be the big score you've been looking for." />
    <Mission Number="2" Name="Exploration" Location="Mine" Page="21" Intro="You have been hired by a foreign investor to investigate and explore a claim that he has just purchased in the area. He will pay you well if it pans out to be half as good a deal as he was lead to believe.&#xA;All you have to do is see how big the mine really is and clean out any unsavory squatters that have moved in. Sounds simple, right? It always does." />
    <Mission Number="3" Name="Seal the Void Gate" Location="Mine" Page="22" Intro="A stable Void Gate has opened deep in a nearby mine and all manner of horrific monstrosities are pouring out! Finding a way to seal the gate within an ancient occult tome, the local Holy Man lead a group down into the mine a few days ago to try to put a stop to the rampage.

Not this time." />

When one Gate closes, two more open up around it! There's only one thing for it, you'll have to blow the mine! Collecting up all the heavy-duty explosives the local Frontier Town has to offer, you set off into the depths to find a couple of good spots to plant the charges that will collapse the entrance tunnels for good. Of course, the only trick is that you also have to get out before it blows. This one's gonna be close!" />

After several attempts to find the bottom, they concluded that it was best to just cover over it and move on. But the pit, it would seem, had other plans. Bursting through the boards they tried to block it off with, the souls of the damned have erupted from below, and now pour freely into our world! This Hell Pit has to be sealed up for good... and fast!" />
    <Mission Number="3" Name="The Lost Journal" Location="Mine" Notes="Fixed Map" Page="30" Intro="While talking to the local newspaper man in town, he tells you that he thinks he has finally worked out the location of the Lost Journal; a legendary missing volume in the notes of Doctor Hedgebrook, the first man to travel through a gateway to another world, and make it back alive.

Of course, there are also stories of vicious serpentmen tribes and massive reptilian creatures that stalk the thick, swampy forests. But, for a chance at riches and immortality, it could just be worth the risk." />
    <Mission Number="5" Name="Cursed Idol" Location="Mine,Jargono" Page="24" Intro="While in the Saloon, an old prospector hobbles up to you and asks for your help.&#xA;&quot;It's my fault! It's all my fault! I brought back this here ancient statue I found on an expedition to another world. At first, I was overjoyed by the find! I mean, that thing has got to be worth a fortune, right? But ever since I took the damned thing, it's been nothing but trouble. My horse done keeled over and died on the trail, I was ambushed by demons on the way into town, and ever since I've been back, things have started going wrong for this whole place! We've been hit by three Void Twisters in the last week! It's cursed I tells ya'! I mean, I know I shouldn't have taken it from that ancient burial ground in the swamps, but I didn't think it would actually be cursed! I gotta put this thing back where I found it, before it kills us all. I would do it myself, but I broke my leg walking down the street... just walkin' down the damn street! You gotta help me!&quot;" />
    <Mission Number="6" Name="Temple of Dread" Location="Mine,Jargono" Page="35" Intro="A lone survivor stumbled into town this morning, babbling incoherently about his posse gettin' massacred, and an ancient temple in the swamps. Coaxing more information out of him, it would appear that his group discovered a massive temple ruin through a portal, half-sunken into the swamp, and full of wondrous relics and treasures beyond reckoning. It's hard to tell exactly where it is located from his description, but you definitely have enough to go in the right direction. With a far-off look, the man just keeps repeating the same phrase... and it chills you to the bone. &quot;There's only death there! It's a... Temple of Dread... Temple of Dread... Temple of Dread.&quot;" />

People spoke in hushed whispers of terrible nightmares, filled with hideous monsters and vivid scenes of fire and death. By early the next evening, three more townsfolk were dead in their sleep! But the real horror was seeing the death up close, as one poor soul fell asleep in his chair at the saloon, and aoke screaming, with burning eyes, before bursting into flame and showering into ash.&#xA;It's been days now since you slept, and every moment is a fight to stay awake.
