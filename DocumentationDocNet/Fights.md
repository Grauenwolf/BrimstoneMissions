# Fights

## Enemy Placement

Place enemies in reverse initiative order (lowest first.)

Place in back-left corner first. The lay out in checker-board pattern left to right, back to front. Skip one square between each model.

### Ambush

* +2 Initiative on first turn
* Place next to randomly selected heroes.
* An ambush immediately ends the current turn.
  * Except if triggered before anyone moves such as an Hold Back the Darkness roll

## Targeting

Normal targeting is randomly distributed.

Evenly distributed random targets if there are more heroes than enemies of that type.

### Melee

**Retarget if current target is no longer adjecent.**

1. Randomly target hero within movement range. 
2. Move as far as possible to reach target. (This will often place the enemy behind the hero.)
3. If no hero within movement range, move towards closest hero. (Does not count as targeting.)

### Ranged

**Retarget every turn.**

1. If no heroes are within attack range, move towards cloest hero until within attack range.
2. Randomly target 'adject' hero. 
3. If no adject heroes, randomly target hero in attack range. 

### Melee or Ranged

**Retarget every turn if current target is no longer adjecent.**

1. If hero is adjecent, do not move and make a melee attack. 
2. If no heroes are within attack range, move towards cloest hero until within attack range. 
    (Avoid moving adjecent to hero.)
3. Randomly target 'adject' hero. (This shouldn't happen)
4. If no adject heroes, randomly target hero in attack range.
