# Fights

## Enemy Placement

Place enemies in reverse initiative order (lowest first.) Enemies with variable initiative are always placed first.

Place in back-left corner first. The lay out in checker-board pattern left to right, back to front. Skip one square between each model.

### Ambush

* +2 Initiative on first turn
* Place enemies in initiative order.
* Place next to randomly selected heroes, evenly distributed if there are more heroes than enemies of that type.
* An ambush immediately ends the current turn.
  * Except if triggered before anyone moves such as a Hold Back the Darkness roll

### Ambush + Shootout

1. Randomly choose 1 hero
2. Place all enemies on same tile, but as far away as possible.
3. If there isn't enough room, they may be placed in adjacent tiles. Again, as far away as possible.

### Ambush + Support

1. Randomly choose 1 hero
2. Place all enemies on same tile, but as far away as possible.
3. If there isn't enough room, they may be placed in adjacent tiles. Again, as far away as possible.

### Ambush + Immobile

1. Randomly choose 1 hero
2. Place all enemies on same tile, but as far away as possible.

## Targeting

Normal targeting is randomly distributed.

Evenly distributed random targets if there are more heroes than enemies of that type.

### Melee

**Retarget if current target is no longer adjacent.**

1. Randomly target hero within movement range. 
2. Move as far as possible to reach target. (This will often place the enemy behind the hero.)
3. If no hero within movement range, move towards closest hero. (Does not count as targeting.)

### Ranged

**Retarget every turn.**

1. If no heroes are within attack range, move towards closest hero until within attack range.
2. Randomly target 'adject' hero. 
3. If no adject heroes, randomly target hero in attack range. 

### Melee or Ranged

**Retarget every turn if current target is no longer adjacent.**

1. If hero is adjacent, do not move and make a melee attack. 
2. If no heroes are within attack range, move towards closest hero until within attack range. 
    (Avoid moving adjacent to hero.)
3. Randomly target 'adject' hero. (This shouldn't happen)
4. If no adject heroes, randomly target hero in attack range. 

### Acid Blobs

**Retarget if possible to move to larger group of heroes.**

1. Move to as many heroes as possible.
2. Randomly target if [1] results in a tie.

### Shootout

**Retarget every turn.**

1. If adjacent, attempt to retreat on a D6 (4+). 
2. If retreating, free move shortest distance to no longer be adjacent. Go to step 4.
3. If failed to retreat, melee combat instead of range. Target random adjacent hero.
4. If not adjacent, target random hero without a **Shootout** marker. (Or fewest markers if everyone has one.)
5. Move shortest distance, up to max move, to put target within attack range. May not end movement adjacent to a hero.
6. If target still isn't in range, target random hero in range, preferring target with fewest shootout markers.

### Support

1. If adjacent, move full distance to be as far away as possible without ending turn adjacent to another hero.
2. If no adjacent and no heroes on same map tile, move shortest distance to be on same map tile as the closest hero without ending turn adjacent to the hero.
3. Never targets a hero or move to Melee attack.

## Hero Attacks

### Attack Rolls

* Min target number: 2+
* Max target number: 6+ (unless rolling D8 for attacks)
* Max dice: 6 Combat or 6 Shots in a single attack. [Official Rule Change]

### Free Attacks

Max one free attack per turn, used at any time during the hero’s activation. 

Use the weapon's Combat value instead of the hero's Combat.

### Dynamite / Bomb

See [Dynamite/Bomb](SideBag.htm) token.

### Splash Damage [Official Rule Change]

Splash Damage is extra Damage done as a by-product to other models nearby the original Target model of an Attack.

* Splash Damage may NOT gain Damage modifiers, unless specifically noted as such in the Damage modifier’s text.
* Splash Damage DOES gain XP for the Hero that caused the Damage (unless noted otherwise).
* Attacks with an area of effect (e.g. Dynamite) do not count as Splash Damage.

## End of Fight

### Catch Your Breath

* If you got a turn, heal D3 wounds/sanity damage.
* If you didn't get a turn, recover 1 grit OR heal D6 wounds/sanity damage.

### Loot

* Each Hero: 1 Loot card per Threat Card (max 3) 
* Allies do not get loot cards.
