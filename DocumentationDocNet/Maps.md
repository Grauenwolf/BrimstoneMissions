# Maps and Movement

## Basic Movement

Move D6 squares. If you roll a 1, also take a [Grit](Grit.htm). (You may use this immediately to avoid exceeding your Max Grit.)

Use one **Grit** to move +1D6 squares. 

Diagonals are allowed unless the wall blocks the corner.

@alert tip
Optional Rule **Fixed Movement**: Move 4 spaces per turn. (Continue to roll movement die for the purpose of recovering grit.
@end



## Escape

Roll D6 for Escape to move away from an enemy model. 

Roll once per turn and keep the roll in case you move next to other enemies later in your movement.

## KO'd

A hero may drag a KO'd hero at the cost of 2 MP per square (instead of the usual 1/square). Must in the same or adjecent square.


## Large (L) Models

Large (L) and bigger models may push through other models.

* Enemy models may only displace smaller enemy models.
* Hero models (i.e. Sumo) may only displace smaller hero models.
* Swap spaces with displaced model.

## Extra-Large (XL) Models

XL models pick one square under their base as the 'anchor' from which movement is calculated.

XL models can overlap walls so long as half their base is on the map.

When pushing through other models, the displaced model may move 2 or more squares as needed.

## Map Tiles

If you are on a puzzle connector (half-square) you are considered to be on both tiles.

## Gateways

Movement through gateways is instanteous, as if the sqaures are adjecent. 

### Melee Attacks

Melee attacks through gates work as if adjecent.

### Line of Sight

You may only trance line-of-sight through a gateway if you are standing next to it.

### Lantern

The lantern works through a gateway as if the tiles were adjecent.
