# Side Bag

The side bag can normally hold 5 tokens. 

Gold and Dark Stone are not considered side bag tokens, though may be placed on the side bag for convenience.

* During a fight, tokens may only be used on adjecent heroes.
* Outside a fight, tokens may only be used on any hero.

## Tokens

* Exotic Herbs: Removes D3 Corruption
* Tequila: Heals 2D6 Sanity
* Fine Cigar: Armor 3+ until end of turn
* Dark Stone Shiv: TODO [Official Rule Change]
* Dynamite: (see below)

## Dynamite / Bomb

* This counts as your ranged attack
* Roll to-hit. If failed, bounce D3 times. 
  * Roll D8 once per bounce.
  * Ignore bounces that hit a wall.
* Damage is D6 wounds, ignoring Defense, to sqaure and all adjecent squares.

@alert tip
Optional Rule **Dangerous Dynamite**: If you take 10+ wounds from a single source, roll D6 per Dyanmite token. On a 1-2, roll damage as per normal.
