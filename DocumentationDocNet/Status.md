# Status and Status Markers/Tokens 

## KO'd

A hero is KO's as soon as their Wounds or Sanity Damage equal their max.

A hero may drag another hero at the cost of 2 MP per square (instead of the usual 1/square). Must in the same or adjecent square.


### Recovery

At end of fight, roll for injury/madness. Then heal 2D6 Wounds/Sanity.

Mid-fight: A hero may revive another character on his turn if:
* They are adjecent
* There are no enemies on the same tile
* Assisting hero gives up Attack.

@alert tip
Optional Rule **Hard-Core Mode**: If not recovered by start of next turn, hero is killed.
@end
