# Turn Summary

If all characters are KO'd at the same time, the mission is failed and KO'd heroes must roll for injury/madness.

**Run away**, ending the mission immediately. The mission is failed and KO'd heroes must roll for injury/madness.


## 1. Hold Back the Darkness

Lantern Bearer rolls 2D6 versus the depth chart. (May not reroll using Grit.)

* Doubles: See the chart for the world you're in. 
  * This doesn't affect characters in another world from the lantern bearer.
* Fail (not doubles): Advance the darkness marker one spot. This may trigger a **Growing Dread** or **Darkness** card.
* Pass: Nothing happens, yet.

If you draw a **Darkness** card, reveal it now. 
If you draw a **Growing Dread** card, add it to the stack. These are revealed during the final battle. 

If the **Darkness** marker reaches the mine entrance, the mission is failed.

@alert tip
Optional Rule **Below the Darkness**: If Darkness marker is higher than the Depth marker, all enemies gain a free Elite ability.
@end

## 2. Models Activate in Initiative Order

If two models are tied and one is an enemy, the enemy moves first.

@alert tip
House Rule: Characters may delay their turn.
@end

### 2.a Start of Activation

Equip/un-equip items. (This happens *before* anything else.)

Roll D6 for [movement](Maps.htm). If you roll a 1, gain one [Grit](Grit.htm).

If you are not within 1 tile of the lantern (i.e. same or adjacent tile), take **D6 Horror Hits**.

Perform other **Start of Activation** tasks.

### 2.b Movement

See [movement](Maps.htm) for details.

@alert tip
House Rule: Spend 1 movement point to **Look Through a Door**, then continue moving.
@end

### 2.c Attacks (if in a fight)

May perform one ranged or melee (Combat) attack per turn.

### 2.c Searching (if not in a fight)

You may either **Look Through a Door** or **Scavenge**.

Allies may not search.

#### Look Through a Door

Draw 1 map card and place an **Exploration** token on it. Then advance the **Depth Track** one spot.

@alert danger
Hard Mode: Draw the **Advanced Encounter** shown on the map card. This is in addition to any exploration tokens you reveal in step 3. 
@end

#### Scavenging

Roll 3D6. For each 6 take a Scavenge card. If at least one 6 was rolled, drop a Scavenged token on the map tile.


| Heroes | Scavenges Allowed | Bonus Scavenges |
| :----: |:-----------------:|:---------------:|
| 1-2    | 1                 |                 |
| 3-4    | 2                 |+1               |
| 5-6    | 3                 |+2               |

Use the 'Bonus' column if the Room/Encounter already allows more than one scavenge.


## 3. Room Exploration

Reveal the **Exploration** token if at least one character is in the room.

All non-enemy encounters are resolved first. Then resolve all enemies as a single Fight.

@alert tip
House Rule: If thematically appropriate, resolve the non-enemy encounter after the fight. For example, when anything that involves searching the room would be done after killing the enemies guarding the room.
@end

Note: If the last **Clue** is revealed, usually the mission will have you ignore the rest of the Exploration token. See the specific mission for details.
