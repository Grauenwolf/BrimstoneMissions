# XP

These rules are for heroes only. [Allies](Allies.htm#ally-xp-and-upgrades) have their own XP rules.

## XP For Fights

* `A`: Gain `A` XP per model killed
* `A + B` each: Gain `A` XP for a wounding attack plus `B` XP per wound. [Official Rule Change]
* +5/Elite Ability. This adds to the `A` value above.


@alert info
The original rule for 'A + B each' was "Gain `A` XP for a successful *wounding hit* plus `B` XP per wound." Now you only get the `A` value once even if you make multiple hits in one attack.
