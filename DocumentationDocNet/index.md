# Anchor
Data Modeling Library in .NET

## Overview

A rich data model forms the foundation of many modern applications. Even as we move to a more functional style paradigm in C#, data structures that accurately represent the information they contain is crucial. 

Tortuga Anchor endeavors to make it easier to build these rich data models by providing base classes and extension methods that can dramatically reduce the amount of boilerplate needed.

The major namespaces are:

* [Collections](Collections.htm)
* [ComponentModel](ComponentModel.htm)
* [DataAnnotations](DataAnnotations.htm)
* [Eventing](Eventing.htm)
* [Metadata](Metadata.htm)
* [Modeling](Modeling.htm)

If you are building MVVM style applications, then the modeling namespace will be the most interesting to you. 

To avoid bloating your list of using statements, the various extension methods are all under the Tortuga.Anchor namespace.
